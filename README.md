# Notes for Rajeev Parmasar

Check out gulpfile.js for an example of browser reloading.

The bootstrap tutorial that I sent you creates a gulpfile that uses an older version of JavaScript(JS).

However, the objective of my gulpfile.js is the same as theirs, so still review the section of the tutorial that talks about it's purpose.

I believe that the only difference between their gulpfile.js and mine is that I added a listener for changes to my custom js files as well.

Let me know if you have any questions.


PS: using the gulpfile requires some knowledge of Node.js
Node.js is simply a JS runtime environment (JS on the command line). It's worth checking out a couple tutorials on it to expand your web developer toolkit. REGARDLESS, everything you need to know to set up browser reloading is in the bootstrap tutorial and in my gulpfile.js
